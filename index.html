          <h3>EMPIRE</h3>
          <p>Marcus Aurelius was born in 121 C.E.. His early education was overseen by the Emperor Hadrian, and he was later adopted by the Emperor Antoninus Pius in 138 C.E.. <br><br>After an initial education in rhetoric undertaken by Fronto, Marcus later abandoned it in favor of philosophy. Marcus became Emperor himself in AD 161, initially alongside Lucius Verus, becoming sole Emperor in AD 169. <br><br> Continual attacks meant that much of his reign was spent on campaign, especially in central Europe. However, he did find time to establish four Chairs of Philosophy in Athens, one for each of the principal philosophical traditions (Platonic, Aristotelian, Stoic, and Epicurean). He died in AD 180. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Aurelius" id="tribute-link" target="_blank">Learn more here...</a></p>

            <p>Marcus’ reputation as a philosopher rests upon one work, the Meditations. The Meditations take the form of a personal notebook and were probably written while Marcus was on campaign in central Europe, c. AD 171-175. Marcus’s Meditations is perhaps the only document of its kind ever made. It is the private thoughts of the world’s most powerful man giving advice to himself on how to make good on the responsibilities and obligations of his positions. Originally titled,”To Himself,” Meditations is the definitive text on self-discipline, personal ethics, humility, self-actualization, and strength.</p>

          <h4 class="philosophies">PHILOSOPHY</h4>
          <p><span>a. Stoicism</span><br>
According to tradition, Marcus was a Stoic. His ancient biographer, Julius Capitolinus, describes him as such. Marcus also makes reference to a number of Stoics by whom he was taught and, in particular, mentions Rusticus from whom he borrowed a copy of the works of the Stoic philosopher Epictetus (Med. 1.7). </p>

        <p><span>b. The Influence of Epictetus</span><br>
As has been noted, Marcus was clearly familiar with the Discourses of Epictetus, quoting them a number of times (see Med. 11.33-38).</p>

        <p><span>c. The Three topoi</span><br>
Central to Epictetus’ philosophy is his account of three topoi, or areas of study. He suggests that the apprentice philosopher should be trained in three distinct areas or topoi (see Epictetus Discourses 3.2.1-2):
Desires (orexeis) and aversions (ekkliseis);
Impulse to act (hormas) and not to act (aphormas);
Freedom from deception, hasty judgement, and anything else related to assents (sunkatatheseis).

        <p><span>d. Philosophical Exercises</span><br>
In the Meditations Marcus engages in a series of philosophical exercises designed to digest philosophical theories, to transform his character or ‘dye his soul’ in the light of those theories (see e.g. Med. 5.16), and so to transform his behavior and his entire way of life.
